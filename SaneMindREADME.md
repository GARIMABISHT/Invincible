Mental health and well-being, across civilizations, have received attention although variably. 

The ancient science of Yoga emphasizes ‘Chittavrittinirodha’ i.e., to calm the oscillation of the mind towards stability.

Public Health focus was provided by the landmark World Health Report – 2001
 titled “Mental health: new hope, new understanding”.

Beginning with the World Health Day 2001 theme “Stop exclusion ¬– Dare to care”, there has been a renewed effort to mainstream mental health along with the growing Non-Communicable Disease agenda. 

Usually people with mental illness fear how the society will treat them. 
Because of which, a life of misery and solitude is shoved down their throats. 
What we want to provide them, is a platform for rejuvenating their social life.
A platform where they will find companions without being judged. 
We call this life changing platform, SANEMIND.
